# Getting Started

Learn how to setup and use knitwork-x in your project.

## Introduction

knitwork-x provides utilities to generate JavaScript and TypeScript code programmatically. It is forked from [knitwork](https://github.com/unjs/knitwork) and adds comprehensive TypeScript generation helpers (classes, interfaces, functions, control flow, and more).

## Installation

Install knitwork-x from npm:

:pm-install{name="knitwork-x"}

## Usage

Import the helpers you need and call them to generate code strings:

```ts
import { genImport, genClass, genConstructor } from 'knitwork-x'

// Generate an import statement
const imp = genImport('vue', ['ref', 'computed'])
// => import { ref, computed } from "vue";

// Generate a class
const cls = genClass('Counter', [
  genConstructor([], ['super();'])
], { export: true })
// => export class Counter { constructor() { super(); } }
```
